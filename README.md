# Virtual Memory Simulator
This Java application simulates virtual memory management using various page replacement algorithms.

## Overview
The Virtual Memory Simulator (VMSimulator) is a tool designed to simulate memory management strategies commonly used in operating systems. It provides a framework to experiment with different page replacement algorithms and analyze their performance.

## Features

### Support for Multiple Algorithms: VMSimulator supports three page replacement algorithms: Optimal (opt), Clock (clock), and Least Recently Used (LRU).

Command-Line Interface: Easily configure and run simulations through a command-line interface.
Tracefile Support: Simulate memory accesses using tracefiles containing memory reference patterns.
Summary Statistics: Obtain summary statistics on the performance of the chosen algorithm.
Usage

## To use VMSimulator, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
Compile the Code: Compile the Java source files using javac.

Copy code
javac VMSimulator.java MemorySimulator.java ReplacementAlgorithm.java OptimalAlgorithm.java ClockAlgorithm.java LRUCache.java
Run the Simulator: Execute the VMSimulator class with the appropriate command-line arguments.

Copy code

java VMSimulator -n <numframes> -a <opt|clock|lru> <tracefile>
<numframes>: The number of frames in the memory.

<opt|clock|lru>: Choose one of the supported algorithms.

<tracefile>: Path to the tracefile containing memory access patterns.

Example

# Copy code
java VMSimulator -n 10 -a opt example.trace
This command runs the simulator with 10 frames using the Optimal algorithm, simulating memory accesses based on the content of example.trace.

## Supported Algorithms
Optimal (opt): Simulates the optimal page replacement algorithm by predicting future memory accesses.
Clock: Implements the Clock page replacement algorithm.
LRU: Implements the Least Recently Used page replacement algorithm.
